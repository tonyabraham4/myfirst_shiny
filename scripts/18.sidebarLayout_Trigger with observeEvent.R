# Trigger with observeEvent()
# In this app we want two things to happen when an action button is clicked:
  
# A message printed to the console stating how many records are shown.
# A table output of those records.
# While observeEvent() will print a message to the console when the action button is clicked on your local machine, 
# it will not currently work on the DataCamp platform. It is important, however, to learn how to do this for your future Shiny apps!


# Instructions
# Use observeEvent() to print a message to the console when the action button is clicked.
# Set up a table output that will print only when action button is clicked, but not when other inputs that go into the creation of that output changes. 
# Note that the corresponding render function for tableOutput() is renderTable().
