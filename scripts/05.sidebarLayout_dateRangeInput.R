# Convert dateInput to dateRangeInput
# The app on the right can be used to display movies from a particular date onwards. 
# Instead we would like to select movies between two given dates. Hence we need to convert the dateInput widget to a dateRangeInput widget. 
# This input will yield a vector (input$date) of length two, where the first element is the start date and the second is the end date.

# Review the help files for the two widgets by typing ?dateInput and ?dateRangeInput in the console.

# In this exercise you will only need to update the dateInput widget. The accompanying updates have already been made in the 
# helper text in the UI as well as in the server function.
