# In this exercise we introduce an action button that will be used to update the plot title when the button is clicked. 
# This is an example of delaying a reaction (until the button is clicked), which we can accomplish with the eventReactive() function.
# eventReactive() takes two main arguments: The first (eventExpr) is what to condition on, and the second (valueExpr) is what should happen when the event expression is happens.
